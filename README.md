Project:	We will construct a playable game using Unity for and will use C# for scripting all the game logic. Art and scripting assets will be chosen from those available free online or created by the team. We will give credit where it is due. Each team member will contribute to the foundation mechanics and logic of the game as well as the finished project based.
Game details: We will build a space shooter where the player controls a ship as it travels through space destroying obstacles and enemies in their path and avoiding enemy weapons fire and invincible obstacles. The player ship will have weapons as well as mining tools used to get resources from destroyed asteroids as well as scraps from other ships. Other ships will include pirates, or authorities considering your cargo as contraband. Players will earn points to build a high score, and collect currency that they can use to upgrade their shipâ€™s capabilities. There will be several levels that each team member can develop.

Additional features: (wish list)
Multiple weapons/upgrades
Different ships to choose from
Missions? (miner or fighter contracts)
Different Worlds- possible exploration of said Worlds
Adventure vs Arcade Mode 
Mobile deployment (android and or IOS)

Sprint plan
First step: To make sure everyone has their development environment set up and familiarize everyone to a process of how project will be contributed to.

Second Step: Organize our to-do list and familiarize everyone on how a user is visibly assigned to different items to be worked on. We will create a backlock full of available items that any of us can pick from to work on.

Third Step: We will meet and discuss the highest priority features and bugs to be worked on for the next sprint to get closer to our goal of a finished product.

We will be using GitKraken with Unity and use the following process: creating a new branch with name formatted as bug/bugName or feature/featureName before work is done on the checked out code. Once bug or feature is complete on checked out branch, team member will do a pull request to have the changes be peer reviewed before it is approved and merged into Dev. Dev branch goes through QA process before it is merged into Master.

Goals: Our primary goal is to set up a foundation of the game environment.  We will continue reviewing tutorials relevant to the game we are making. We will adopt code and assets from these tutorials and modify them and credit 3rd party sources where appropriate.

Method of communication: We are primarily using Slack as our medium of communication. We will also meet in person or use a conference application to review everyone's current setup and make sure we are on the same page.
